This repository contains the Python script (as a Jupyter notebook) for analyzing slope of the frequency gradient and the phase gradient in spreadouts. This also contains scripts developed by Gregor MÃ¶nke (gregor.moenke@embl.de) for wavelet analysis: `lib_psm.py` and `wavelet_analysis.py`.

Sample data to run the script are available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4017344. These data and the scripts have to be saved in the same directory.
